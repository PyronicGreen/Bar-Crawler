**Bar Crawler** is a directory where bartenders can promote their bar shifts to patrons thar are looking for a particular type of bar experience. 

Bartenders are able to define the shift they are working, from the location and time to drinks and entertainment available. Patrons can then search through the available events and RSVP to as many as they'd like.
